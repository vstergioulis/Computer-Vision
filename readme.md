The amin goal of the project is to create a panorama of stitched images, using different blending techniques. The project though, focuses on the algorithms of image stitching, just as RANSAC, Homography Matrix estimation, etc.


In order to execute the python program we use the following:

python main.py --folder my_data  --RANSAC_thres 0.5 --blending simple

in the folder field you use the folder name, that exists in the same directory as the project and where the images to be stitched are a way that the
left most image is first, the left to center image is second, etc
